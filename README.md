## Monad of Î»ife
Once again, another implementation of my favorite game, Conway's Game of Life, this time written in Haskell!

### Controls
* r - reset cells (randomized)
* q - quit

### Parameters
You have to supply two command line parameters specifying the dimensions of the world:
* life width height
* For example 'life 30 30' starts the game with a 30x30 grid.

### License
The code is released under the MIT license. Please refer to the LICENSE file.
